# PRD: Multi-Model Parallel Chat

## Overview
Enable users to receive responses from multiple AI models simultaneously within a single chat session, allowing for comparison and enhanced roleplay experiences.

## Problem Statement
Currently, users can only interact with one AI model at a time per chat session. This limits their ability to:
- Compare different model responses for the same prompt
- Experience varied character interpretations
- Leverage strengths of different models simultaneously

## Goals
- **Primary**: Allow users to select multiple AI models for a single chat session
- **Secondary**: Display parallel responses in an intuitive, organized manner
- **Tertiary**: Maintain performance and user experience with concurrent streaming

## Target Users
- Power users who want to compare model outputs
- Roleplayers seeking varied character interpretations
- Users exploring different AI model capabilities

## User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want to add multiple AI models to my chat session so I can receive different perspectives on the same prompt
2. **As a user**, I want to see clearly which response came from which model so I can distinguish between them
3. **As a user**, I want responses to stream in parallel so I don't wait longer than necessary
4. **As a user**, I want to easily manage (add/remove) models during an active chat session

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Changes
- **Chat Settings**: Extend `ChatSettingsMenu` to support multiple model selection
- **Message Display**: Modify `MessageList` and `MessageItem` to handle parallel responses
- **Streaming**: Update `StreamingMessage` to support multiple concurrent streams
- **UI Layout**: Design multi-column or grouped response layout

### Backend Integration
- **API Extension**: Modify chat API to accept multiple model IDs
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handle multiple SSE streams for parallel model responses
- **Response Formatting**: Ensure responses include model identification

### Data Model Changes
- **Session Config**: Extend session configuration to store multiple model IDs
- **Message Structure**: Update message types to support model attribution
- **Streaming State**: Track streaming state per model

## User Experience Flow
1. User opens chat session settings
2. User selects multiple AI models from available list
3. User sends message
4. System initiates parallel requests to all selected models
5. Responses stream in simultaneously, clearly labeled by model
6. User can continue conversation with all models responding

## Success Metrics
- Users can successfully select and use multiple models
- Response times remain acceptable (within 20% of single-model performance)
- UI remains intuitive and not cluttered
- No increase in error rates

## Technical Considerations
- **Performance**: Concurrent API calls vs sequential
- **Error Handling**: Partial failures (some models succeed, others fail)
- **Rate Limiting**: OpenRouter API limits with multiple concurrent requests
- **Memory Usage**: Managing multiple streaming connections
- **Cost Implications**: Multiple model usage per message

## Out of Scope (v1)
- Model-specific configuration per session
- Response comparison tools
- Model preference/weighting
- Response merging or synthesis

## Dependencies
- Backend API support for multiple model requests
- OpenRouter API rate limits and billing considerations
- Current SSE streaming infrastructure

## Timeline Estimate
- **Design & Planning**: 1-2 days
- **Backend API Changes**: 2-3 days
- **Frontend Implementation**: 3-4 days
- **Testing & Polish**: 1-2 days
- **Total**: ~1-2 weeks

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: API rate limiting with multiple concurrent requests
  - **Mitigation**: Implement request queuing and retry logic
- **Risk**: Complex UI becomes confusing
  - **Mitigation**: User testing and iterative design refinement
- **Risk**: Increased backend load
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor performance and implement caching where appropriate
